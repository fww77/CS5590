The differences between the results of Linear Discriminant Analysis and Logistic Regression could 
be caused by a number of items. One reason could be that Logistic Regression does not do quite as well 
as Linear Discriminant Analysis when the sample size is small and I chose less than optimal split in the training and test sets. 
Another reason could be that the petals of the iris are well separated and Logistic Regression is not as stable as 
Linear Discriminant Analysis when this is the case. This could also explain the wide range of accuracy scores we got when using Logistic Regression.
