Output from code with a training/ testing ratio of 80/20:
The RDF kernel applied gives a score of: 0.9866666666666667
The Linear kernel applied gives a score of: 0.9666666666666667

It appears that the RDF kernel gives more accurate results. 
This is because the RDF uses curved lines to group the data points giving a better fit.  
I donâ€™t think that there can be an improvement in this. A score of 98.6% is high enough.
